# Umbraco Hodgepodge

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

This collection of miscellaneous Umbraco components are things that felt too small to be their own project.

But they needed somewhere to publicly live, so here we are.


## PreValue Editors

- Checkbox List
- Dropdown List
- Name Value Options (used for the Named Dropdown prevalues)


## Property Editors

- Country Picker
- Inline Checkbox
- Named Dropdown
- Named Dropdown and Textbox Pair
- Textbox Pair
- UTC DateTime Picker


## Usage and Contributing

Currently, I have no plans to release these components as a standalone Umbraco package. My advice is to cherry-pick the components that you want to use on your own projects. If at some point the Umbraco community creates a demand for this collection of components, I can look at releasing it.

In terms of contributings to this collection, please feel free to send over any pull requests. I'll be happy to discuss.
